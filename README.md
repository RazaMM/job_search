# job_search

A job application tracking app.

The app was just a test project to help me with learning the basics of Flutter.
It’s not something that’s being actively worked on or developed.
The main goal was to try out Flutter concepts like building UIs and handling state,
so it’s more of a learning tool than a finished app.
There aren’t any plans to add to it or update it right now.

If you want to use it yourself, you will need to have flutter and it's dependencies installed, and then build it yourself.

Right now I have only tested it on MacOS so if you are on Linux or Windows you will have to figure that out yourself.
